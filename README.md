## Daily market summary

A fully automated daily market summary, pushed to your phone via Telegram every weekday morning. **100% free** — it runs on GitHub Actions and uses GitHub Models for the AI summary, so there are no API bills, no credit card, and no laptop required.

## How it works

```
GitHub Actions (cron, weekdays 7:30 AM ET)
        │
        ▼
market_summary.py
  1. Pulls SPY + watchlist prices via yfinance
  2. Pulls macro headlines from financial RSS feeds (CNBC, MarketWatch, Yahoo)
  3. Sends the raw data to an LLM (GitHub Models, free) to condense into one clean message
  4. Telegram bot pushes it to your phone
  5. (optional) Saves the day's briefing to a **Market Daily** database in Notion
```

The AI step uses [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models), GitHub's free inference API. The workflow's built-in token gets access automatically via the `models: read` permission — no key to create. If the model call ever fails (e.g. rate limit), the script sends the raw price/headline briefing instead, so you always get your message.

## Setup

### 1. Create your Telegram bot (free, ~5 minutes)

1. Install Telegram on your phone if you don't have it.
2. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), send `/newbot`, and follow the prompts (pick any name, e.g. "Market Summary"). BotFather replies with a **bot token** like `123456789:AAF...` — save it.
3. Open a chat with your new bot (BotFather gives you a link to it) and send it any message, e.g. "hi". This is required so the bot is allowed to message you.
4. Get your **chat id**: visit this URL in a browser, with your token filled in:

   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates
   ```

   Find `"chat":{"id":123456789,...}` in the response — that number is your chat id.

### 2. Add repository secrets

In this repo: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**. Add both:

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | The token from BotFather |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat id from step 1.4 |

That's it — the AI summary needs no key at all.

### 3. (Optional) Customize the watchlist

Default is `SPY, QQQ, DIA, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT`. To change it, go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables tab → New repository variable**, name it `WATCHLIST`, and set it to a comma-separated list like `SPY,QQQ,TSLA,AMD`.

### 4. Test it

Go to the **Actions** tab → **Daily market summary** → **Run workflow**. Check the *dry run* box to print the summary in the logs without sending anything, or leave it unchecked for a real end-to-end test — you should get a Telegram message within a minute.

After that, it runs automatically every weekday at 7:30 AM ET — nothing else to do.

### Notion finance log (optional)

If you already set up Notion for the [planner sync](#notion-planner), the market summary reuses the same `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID` secrets. Each weekday run adds one row to a **Market Daily** database (created automatically on first run) with the date, AI summary, and watchlist snapshot. Re-runs on the same day are skipped so you never get duplicates.

On your Notion hub page, you'll end up with two databases side by side:

| Database | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **AI Planner** | Tasks, deadlines, and calendar events from email |
| **Market Daily** | Daily watchlist prices + AI market briefing |

Share your hub page with the integration (**••• → Connections → your integration**) and add the two secrets if you haven't already. Then run **Daily market summary** once to see the first row appear.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
DRY_RUN=1 python market_summary.py   # prints the raw briefing, no keys needed
```

To test the AI step locally, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a fine-grained personal access token with the `models: read` permission.

## Tweaking

- **Schedule** — edit the `cron` line in `.github/workflows/daily-summary.yml` (times are UTC; 11:30 UTC = 7:30 AM ET in summer).
- **Model** — set an `LLM_MODEL` repository variable (same Variables tab as the watchlist). Any id from the [GitHub Models catalog](https://github.com/marketplace/models) works, e.g. `openai/gpt-4o` or `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`. Default is `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
- **News sources / keyword filter** — edit `RSS_FEEDS` and `MACRO_KEYWORDS` at the top of `market_summary.py`.
- **Summary style / length** — edit the system prompt in `summarize_with_llm()`.
- **Interview pitch** — rotates weekly from a curated list in `INTERVIEW_IDEAS` at the top of `market_summary.py`. Edit or add ideas there; the AI ties it to today's headlines when it can.

## Daily AI agenda

Every morning at 7:00 AM ET, an AI reads your Outlook calendar (next 48 hours) and inbox (last 24 hours), figures out what actually needs your attention, and sends you a Telegram message with three sections: **TODAY** (your schedule), **NEEDS ACTION** (emails with deadlines or that need replies), and **SHOULD SCHEDULE** (things from email that belong on your calendar, with suggested free slots). Newsletters and promo noise are filtered out by the AI.

```
GitHub Actions (cron, daily 7:00 AM ET)
        │
        ▼
daily_agenda.py
  1. Pulls your calendar + recent inbox via Microsoft Graph
  2. AI (GitHub Models, free) turns it into a prioritized morning plan
  3. Telegram bot pushes it to your phone
```

### Setup (builds on the market summary setup)

You already have the Telegram bot and secrets from the market summary. Two additions:

**1. Add a `GH_PAT` secret.** This lets the pipeline keep your Microsoft sign-in fresh automatically (Microsoft rotates tokens; this stores the new one each run).

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token).
2. Note: anything, e.g. `agenda pipeline`. Expiration: **No expiration**. Scopes: check the top-level **repo** box. Click **Generate token**.
3. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`) and add it as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`.

**2. Sign in to Microsoft (once).**

1. Go to the **Actions** tab → **Microsoft sign-in (run once)** → **Run workflow**.
2. Open the running job's log (click the run, then **device-login**). Within a few seconds it prints a link (`https://login.microsoft.com/device`) and a short code.
3. On your phone, open the link, enter the code, and sign in with the Microsoft account whose Outlook you want summarized. Approve the permissions (read your mail and calendar).
4. The log will print "Success! Signed in as ..." and store the token as a secret automatically.

Then test it: **Actions → Daily AI agenda → Run workflow**. It runs daily at 7:00 AM ET after that.

### Notes

- **Privacy:** email subjects and previews are sent to GitHub Models (GitHub's AI service) to build the summary. They are never printed in workflow logs.
- **No Azure setup needed:** sign-in uses Microsoft's public "Graph Command Line Tools" app id. If your account blocks it (some school/work accounts do), you'd need your own (free) app registration — open an issue or ask your AI assistant.
- **Timezone:** default is US Eastern. Set a `TIMEZONE` repository variable to change it (Windows format, e.g. `Pacific Standard Time`).
- **Sample data:** the manual run has a "sample data" checkbox that uses built-in fake email/calendar data — useful for testing the pipeline before signing in to Microsoft.

## Notion planner sync

Twice a day (7:30 AM and 5:00 PM ET), an AI reads your Outlook inbox and calendar and keeps a planner database in Notion up to date — your "hub". Calendar events for the next week land as **Event** rows, and the AI extracts real to-dos from email (deadlines, meetings people proposed, things you committed to) as **Task / Deadline / Follow-up / Meeting to schedule** rows. **Timed market events** (Fed/FOMC, CPI/jobs, other high/medium US releases, and watchlist earnings for the next 14 days) auto-create in a dedicated **Markets Calendar** Notion database (with ET times) and also appear in AI Planner as **Markets** events. Newsletters and promo noise are skipped. Every row has a Status (Inbox → Planned → Done) so you can run your week from one board. Nothing is ever added twice — each row carries a hidden dedupe key.

```
GitHub Actions (cron, 7:30 AM + 5:00 PM ET)
        │
        ▼
planner_sync.py
  1. Pulls calendar (next 7 days) + inbox (last 24h) via Microsoft Graph
  2. Pulls US macro releases (high/medium + Fed) and watchlist earnings (next 7 days)
  3. Adds market events to Outlook calendar (30-min blocks, 30-min reminder)
  4. AI (GitHub Models, free) extracts tasks, deadlines & meetings from email
  5. Upserts everything into your "AI Planner" database in Notion
  6. (optional) Telegram ping listing what was added
```

### Setup (builds on the daily agenda setup)

You already have the Microsoft sign-in, `GH_PAT`, and Telegram secrets from the agenda pipeline. Two additions, both free (~5 minutes):

**1. Create a Notion integration.**

1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) → **New integration**. Name it anything (e.g. "AI Planner"), pick your workspace, and under Capabilities make sure **Read**, **Update**, and **Insert content** are enabled.
2. Copy the **Internal Integration Secret** (starts with `ntn_` or `secret_`) and add it as a repository secret named `NOTION_TOKEN`.

**2. Pick (or create) a Notion page to hold the planner.**

1. In Notion, create a page (e.g. "Planner Hub") or pick an existing one.
2. On that page: **••• menu → Connections → Add connection →** your integration. (Without this the bot can't see the page.)
3. Copy the page's URL (**••• menu → Copy link**) and add it as a repository secret named `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID` (the full URL is fine — the id is extracted automatically).

On the first run the bot creates an **"AI Planner"** database under that page with Name, Type, Status, Due, Source, From, and Notes columns. Later runs find it by title and only add what's new — you can move it, add views (a calendar view on the **Due** property works great), or add your own columns freely.

Then test it: **Actions → Notion planner sync → Run workflow**. Check *dry run* to see what would be added without writing anything, or run it for real and watch the rows appear in Notion. After that it runs automatically twice a day.

**Main calendar (Outlook):** market events are written to your **default Outlook calendar** as `[Markets] …` (free/busy = free, 30‑min reminder, category Markets). That is the calendar Notion Calendar / phone calendar shows if Outlook is connected.

To see them in the **Notion Calendar app**:
1. Open [calendar.notion.so](https://calendar.notion.so)
2. Settings → add / connect the **same Microsoft/Outlook account** you use for Microsoft sign-in
3. Make sure that calendar is toggled **visible**
4. Look for `[Markets] MSFT earnings`, etc. on Jul 29–30 (and other Fed/macro times)

Or in Outlook on the web: [outlook.live.com/calendar](https://outlook.live.com/calendar) → search `Markets`.

**Calendar write permission:** if writes fail, re-run **Microsoft sign-in (run once)** so the token includes `Calendars.ReadWrite`.

**School / `.edu` accounts:** many universities block third-party Microsoft sign-in. Use a **personal** Microsoft account (Outlook.com/Hotmail) during sign-in — especially one that already has your school calendar shared to it. If Outlook writes still fail, add a repository variable `SKIP_OUTLOOK_CALENDAR` = `1`; market events will land in **Notion only** (Markets Calendar database). If Microsoft sign-in is completely blocked, set `SKIP_MICROSOFT` = `1` to sync financial announcements to Notion without email/calendar.

### Notes

- **You stay in control:** the bot only adds rows. It never edits or deletes anything, so your statuses, notes, and re-ordering are safe.
- **Privacy:** like the agenda, email subjects/previews go to GitHub Models for extraction and are never printed in workflow logs.
- **Schedule:** edit the two `cron` lines in `.github/workflows/planner-sync.yml` (times are UTC).

<a name="internship-tracker"></a>

## Internship tracker

A recruiting bot focused on **Dallas / Texas / NYC** finance roles — **S&T, markets rotations, equity research, AM, and IB** — tuned for **bulge bracket + elite boutique** campus programs and **Hispanic / Latino / Black diversity fellowships** (Class of 2029 timeline).

Runs **every day** at 8:00 AM ET.

```
GitHub Actions (daily 8:00 AM ET)
        │
        ▼
internship_tracker.py
  1. Polls Greenhouse + Workday job boards (MS, Citi, Jane Street, Point72, boutiques, etc.)
  2. Watches 25+ curated campus pages — GS, JPM, Evercore, Moelis, HL, Lazard, PJT, Centerview, BlackRock, and more
  3. (optional) Scans Outlook for recruiting emails about internships
  4. Filters for Dallas / NYC / Texas + S&T / markets rotations / AM / equity research / IB
  5. Excludes women-only programs; prioritizes Hispanic / Latino / Black fellowships
  6. Sends Telegram **1–2 months before** programs open so you can network first
  7. Adds new postings to an **Internship Tracker** database in Notion
  8. **Campus Coach** (separate Telegram bot) sends alerts + copy-paste networking messages
```

### Separate bot from market messages

Internship and networking alerts use a **second Telegram bot** so they never mix with your market summary / agenda messages.

**1. Create the networking bot (~2 min)**

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) → `/newbot`
2. Name it something like **Campus Coach** or **Recruiting Scout** (this is the name you see in Telegram)
3. Save the **bot token**
4. Open the new bot, send `hi`, then get your chat id from `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` (same as market bot setup)

**2. Add repository secrets**

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `NETWORKING_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from BotFather for the new bot |
| `NETWORKING_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat id (usually the same number as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) |

Optional variable: `NETWORKING_BOT_NAME` = `Campus Coach` (signature at the bottom of messages)

Your **market bot** secrets stay untouched — market summary and daily agenda keep using `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.

### What Campus Coach sends

When a program is **1–2 months out** or a **new role posts**, you get:

1. **Alert** — firm, program, link
2. **Who to message** — TTU alumni, SEO mentors, RBA contacts
3. **LinkedIn note** — copy-paste ready (under 280 chars)
4. **Longer email** — copy-paste ready for coffee chat asks

Example signature: `— Campus Coach`

### Setup (Notion + optional email scan)

You need `NOTION_TOKEN` and `NOTION_PARENT_PAGE_ID` from the [Notion planner](#notion-planner) setup. For recruiting-email scanning, add Microsoft sign-in from the [daily agenda](#daily-ai-agenda) (`MS_REFRESH_TOKEN` + `GH_PAT`).

Then test it: **Actions → Internship tracker → Run workflow**. Check *dry run* to preview matches in the logs, or check *sample data* to test the email filter without Microsoft. After that it runs **every day at 8:00 AM ET**.

### Customize filters

Set these as repository **variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `INTERNSHIP_LOCATIONS` | `Dallas,DFW,Texas,Lubbock,NYC,New York` | Location keywords |
| `INTERNSHIP_DIVISIONS` | `S&T,AM,IB` | Divisions (markets / AM / IB — all equal) |
| `INTERNSHIP_CLASS_YEARS` | `Freshman,Sophomore,Discovery` | Class years / program types |
| `SKIP_MICROSOFT` | (unset) | Set to `1` to skip recruiting-email scan |

### Notion board

On first run the bot creates an **Internship Tracker** database under your Notion hub page with Firm, Division, Location, Class Year, Program Type, Status (New → Applied → OA → Interview → Offer), URL, and Notes. Re-runs never duplicate — each row has a hidden dedupe key.

Your hub page can hold three databases side by side:

| Database | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **AI Planner** | Tasks, deadlines, and calendar events from email |
| **Market Daily** | Daily watchlist prices + AI market briefing |
| **Internship Tracker** | Finance internship and discovery program postings |

### Notes

- **Daily run:** every morning at 8:00 AM ET, year-round.
- **Early-fall focus:** during August–November the filter is tuned for sophomore discovery programs. Expect most bank discovery programs to post in late Aug–Sep.
- **Dallas:** the filter requires Dallas/DFW/Texas in the posting location, or a national discovery program page that mentions Dallas. Add more cities via `INTERNSHIP_LOCATIONS` if you're also targeting NYC/Houston.
- **Add firms:** edit `GREENHOUSE_BOARDS`, `WORKDAY_SOURCES`, and `CURATED_PROGRAMS` at the top of `internship_sources.py`.
- **Schedule:** edit the `cron` lines in `.github/workflows/internship-tracker.yml` (times are UTC; `0 12 * * *` = 8:00 AM ET in summer).
